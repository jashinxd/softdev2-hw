# Q1: How would you explain to your ducky what this Scheme code does?
# (lambda (a b) (+ a b))
# The scheme code will create a function that takes two variables and adds them together.

# Q2: How would you explain to your ducky what this Scheme code does?
# (define foo (lambda (a b) (+ a b)))
# The scheme code will assign the variable foo to the previously explained function.
